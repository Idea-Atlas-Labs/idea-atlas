# Plug-in hybrid trains

**Claim:** Plug-in hybrid trains use short station-only overhead line to charge on stop and leave under wire, with diesel holding the cruise between towns, capturing most stop-related fuel and schedule cost without electrifying empty miles.

**Status:** ready · lab card · unfinished experiment

**Terms (once):** **Plug-in hybrid train** = a train that can take power from overhead line at stations, store energy onboard (battery or equivalent), and run on diesel (or another onboard source) off-wire — the rail analog of a plug-in hybrid car, not a pure battery train and not continuous corridor electrification. **Pocket / station bubble** = a short overhead-line section centered on a station (platform plus enough track to cover braking into and accelerating out of the stop). **Overhead line** = the formal name for the catenary / contact wire the pantograph takes power from; this card says “wire” in plain speech and “overhead line” in technical detail. **Hybrid consist** = locomotives or trainsets that can take power from the overhead line, store energy onboard (battery or equivalent), and run on diesel (or another onboard source) off-wire. **Dwell** = time stopped at the platform for boarding. **Regen** = regenerative braking that returns kinetic energy to the wire or into the onboard pack. **OHLI / OCI** = overhead-line island / overhead catenary island — European short catenary segments used mainly to recharge battery-electric multiple units (BEMU) on otherwise unelectrified lines; kin infrastructure, different operating thesis. **BEMU** = battery-electric multiple unit (runs on battery between wire sections). **Class I** = major U.S. freight railroads.

Working figures and unknowns (labeled):

- **Where fuel and emissions concentrate (established directional, one corridor):** On North Carolina’s Piedmont passenger service, measured fuel-use and emission hotspots were about **20% of route length** but about **40–50% of trip fuel use and emissions** (NCDOT / NC State RP2020-07, ~2020–21). Acceleration, grade, and speed distinguish hotspot from non-hotspot segments. This supports “stop and grade events dominate a large share of fuel,” not a universal U.S. percentage. **Not found:** a published multi-corridor U.S. share of trip energy that is specifically “acceleration from station stops” stripped of grade and speed-restriction cycles.
- **Acceleration distance order-of-magnitude (working physics / published rates):** Typical initial acceleration bands (FRA / AREMA training material): urban/suburban passenger about **1.0–2.5 mph/s**; express passenger about **0.5–1.25 mph/s**; freight on level about **0.2–0.6 mph/s**. A diesel push-pull commuter set reaching about **60 mph in ~166 s** (Fairmount-line study figures in circulation) implies on the order of **1–2+ miles** of run-up depending on profile; a heavier diesel consist modeled for ~79 mph run-up has been cited around **~4.5 km (~2.8 miles)** (physics walk-through of MBTA-style consist). Electric multiple units accelerate much faster over shorter distances. **Working assumption for pocket design:** size the bubble for the consist you actually run — passenger hybrid pockets are often **about 1–3 miles** each side of the platform as a starting band; freight from a dead stop can need **several miles**. Exact pocket length is **unknown** until a named corridor, consist, and speed target are fixed.
- **European short-wire precedent (established practice, different goal):** German regional BEMU programs use overhead catenary islands on the order of **~0.6–3.7 km** of wire at selected stations (e.g. Pfalznetz OCI plans: Lauterecken-Grumbach ~0.7 km, Kusel ~0.64 km, Winden ~2.95 km, Pirmasens Nord ~2.9 km plus a further partial electrification, Landau ~3.7 km). Those islands mainly **recharge batteries** for the next unelectrified segment; they are not a published U.S. freight-hybrid design. Peak station power in that case study runs about **~2.6–6.7 MW** depending on how many units charge at once. Useful as an existence proof that short station wire is buildable; not a copy-paste length for this card’s diesel-cruise thesis.
- **Dwell charge realism (working assumption):** Intercity and many U.S. passenger dwells are often **a few minutes**; busy hub dwells can run much longer. Standstill pantograph charging is power-limited by contact and feeder design; European BEMU practice treats dwell recharge as real but **timetable-constrained**. **Working assumption:** short passenger dwells alone will not refill a large pack — the pocket’s main jobs are **regen on the way in** and **wired acceleration on the way out**, with dwell topping off what time allows. Overnight or turnback sits are a different, easier charge window. **Not found:** a published U.S. passenger dwell-energy budget that shows a named pack returning to a stated state of charge on ordinary station dwell alone.
- **Wire cost bands (published ranges; wide, site-dependent):** Catenary-only estimates in U.S. discussion often sit about **$2–4.5 million per route-mile** (wire and supports, excluding heavy civil). Broader “complete catenary system” figures sometimes cited in industry summaries run about **$8–12 million per mile**. Dense-corridor all-in programs are far higher (Caltrain Peninsula electrification: about **$2.44 billion** budget on ~**51–52 miles** of corridor — tens of millions per mile when vehicles, traction power, signals, and civil work are included). **Do not invent** a pocket-vs-full savings percentage. The cost thesis is qualitative until a corridor bills short pockets against full-corridor wire on the same scope.
- **Full Class I electrification capital barrier (study estimate, not gospel):** An AAR 2025 study estimate puts full-network Class I catenary electrification on the order of **~$1 trillion** (infrastructure plus rolling stock). Secondary synthesis sometimes frames that as decades of industry profits; treat the dollar figure as a published order-of-magnitude barrier that strengthens “wire-everything is hard,” not as a precise payback clock. **Not found here:** an equal-scope bill that converts that national total into pocket-vs-full savings on a named corridor.
- **ESS pack existence (product examples, not this card’s pack size):** Heavy hybrid / battery-loco products already ship multi-MWh packs — e.g. Progress Rail EMD Joule about **~14.5 MWh / 5.7 MW** (~225k lbs starting TE cited) and Wabtec FLXDrive about **~7 MWh** (~20k cells; liquid cooling claimed for high ambient heat). Dual Li-ion + supercapacitor architectures exist for burst start/brake. Cold-weather note: Li-ion about **~30% capacity loss at -20°C** versus lead-acid **50–60%** — useful for pack honesty, not a pocket design number. Label these as **order-of-magnitude pack existence**; this card’s pack kWh stays unknown until consist, stop spacing, and handoff speed are named.
- **Kin hybrid / ESS evidence (not pocket-vs-full-wire proof):** Yard, shunt, and battery-loco pilots show hybrid traction can cut diesel and local exhaust — e.g. Wabtec FLXDrive CA trials about **11–30% fuel** (~6,200 gal over ~13,320 mi); UP/ZTR yard pilots up to **~80% diesel cut**; Nexrail shunt about **20–30% fuel / ~98% PM**; NS/Alstom CRISI retrofit cited about **~90% emission cut** and **~30% pulling power** on old frames; industry idle on ~12,500 switchers often framed as **~16k gal/yr each → on the order of ~200M gal/yr**. These are **hybrid locomotive / ESS / idle-reduction** results. They do **not** prove station-pocket economics versus full wire, and must not be rewritten as pocket-vs-full savings percentages.
- **OCS gap / arriving SoC (open constraint):** Allowable unelectrified gap between pockets is constrained by the **worst-case lowest battery state of charge** of trains arriving from connecting routes — not by average SoC. Pocket spacing and pack size must cover that worst arriving charge state. Flagged again under Open questions / Stress-test.
- **Kin ideas:** Heavy FedEx rail (dense, time-sensitive heavy cargo between hubs) is the natural first buyer class if stops are frequent enough that stop energy matters. Freight-as-moving-battery is a different pack-and-logistics thesis; do not merge them here.

## 1. The problem

If you already know plug-in hybrid cars, this card is that pattern on rails. A plug-in hybrid car charges from the wall for the short, stop-and-go part of the day and uses gasoline for the long highway. A plug-in hybrid train would charge from short overhead line at stations for the hard leave-the-stop work, and use diesel for the long stretch between towns.

Full U.S. rail electrification usually means hanging wire over every mile between towns. Most of that mileage on many corridors is long, fairly flat cruise, where a modern diesel already does fine. The expensive part of the trip — in fuel, in schedule, and often in local exhaust — is leaving a stop: putting kinetic energy back into a heavy train from zero, and doing it again at the next town.

Wiring the empty prairie to fix the stop problem buys miles of poles, foundations, clearances, substations, and maintenance for a segment that was not the bottleneck. That capital wall is why Class I freight has largely refused corridor electrification — an AAR 2025 study estimate puts full-network Class I catenary on the order of **~$1 trillion** — and why many passenger lines stay diesel even where stops are frequent. Partial answers already exist in pieces — battery locomotives and multi-MWh ESS products, European BEMU islands, dual-modes on the Northeast Corridor — but the U.S. default is still “wire everything or wire nothing.”

## 2. The insight

Match the wire to the physics event that needs it. Braking into a station and accelerating out of it are short, high-power events. Steady cruise between towns is long and lower in power per mile. Put wire only in short bubbles around stations. The train brakes into the pocket and feeds energy back into the wire or the onboard pack — instead of dumping that kinetic energy into resistor-grid dynamic brakes as waste heat, which is still the legacy default on much of the diesel fleet — sits and takes what dwell allows from the wire, then leaves under the wire for the expensive acceleration. Once it is up to speed and clear of the pocket, diesel (or another onboard source) holds the cruise to the next town.

You are buying the part of electrification that actually hurts the fuel bill and the timetable, without paying to electrify empty miles. The bet fails if stop-related energy is a small share on the corridors you care about, if pockets must be so long they approach full electrification, or if dwell-plus-regen cannot keep the hybrid pack honest for the next departure.

## 3. The proposal

### Pocket geometry

Each wired bubble covers: the platform tracks; enough approach track to brake under wire (so regen has somewhere to go); and enough departure track to reach a declared handoff speed before the pantograph drops. Handoff speed is a design choice (for example “most of the way to line speed” versus “out of the yard throat”). Longer pockets cost more and start to look like conventional electrification. Shorter pockets dump more of the acceleration onto the pack or the diesel.

**Working rule, not a measurement:** design the pocket for the consist and speed target on that corridor; use the **~1–3 mile** passenger band and the **multi-mile freight** caution above as starting envelopes, then shrink or grow from measured run-ups. Do not publish a single national pocket length.

### Hybrid consist

The train must do four things in one package:

1. **Collect** from the pocket overhead line (pantograph or equivalent).
2. **Store** enough energy onboard to cover the gap if the next pocket is short, delayed, or de-energized — and to finish an acceleration if the wire ends before handoff speed.
3. **Regen** into the pack when the wire will not accept power, and into the wire when it will.
4. **Cruise on diesel** (or another onboard source) off-wire without treating the pack as a full-corridor battery.

This is not a BEMU that must reach the next island on battery alone across tens of kilometers. Diesel holds the long cruise. The pack is sized for stop cycles and pocket gaps, not for prairie range. Multi-MWh locomotive ESS products (Joule / FLXDrive class — see working figures) show packs of that scale exist; they are **not** a claimed pack size for this card. Pack energy in kWh is **unknown** until consist mass, stop spacing, and handoff speed are named — do not invent it.

**Battery-tender dead weight vs pocket charge:** Hauling a dedicated battery tender for corridor range adds dead weight and cuts payload. Station pockets aim to shrink that by charging at the stops that already cost fuel and time, so the onboard pack covers stop cycles and gaps rather than full prairie range. That is a design argument, not a measured payload gain.

### Station cycle

1. Approach under overhead line; prefer regen into pack or wire over resistor-grid dynamic braking (heat dump) or straight friction.
2. Dwell; take grid power up to contact and feeder limits for whatever minutes the timetable allows.
3. Depart under overhead line at electric (or blended) tractive effort through the expensive low-speed band.
4. Clear the pocket; drop the pantograph; diesel holds cruise.
5. Repeat at the next wired stop.

Must not change when a corridor is chosen: wire stays at the stops that earn it; cruise between pockets stays off full-corridor wire. If the project wires continuous miles “just in case,” the proposal has been abandoned.

### Where it fits first

Best first fit is a **dense-stop passenger or premium time-sensitive freight corridor** where stops are frequent enough that acceleration events are a large share of fuel and delay — kin to Heavy FedEx rail. Worst first fit is a long-haul Class I manifest with rare stops and long steady grades: grade work is a different electrification argument (mountain districts, helper territory), not this card.

### What this is not

- Not a pure battery train that must island-hop without diesel (the pack is for stop cycles and pocket gaps; diesel holds the cruise).
- Not NEC-style continuous electrification.
- Not a claim that diesel cruise is carbon-free; it is a claim about **where wire earns its keep**.
- Not a siting map of U.S. corridors. Corridor choice is an open question for the first test.

## 4. Why this

Full-corridor wire prices the cruise miles you may not need — and the AAR-scale capital barrier for full Class I catenary is why “wire everything” stalls. Full-diesel prices the stop events forever, and still throws braking energy into resistor grids as heat. Plug-in hybrid trains try to buy only the stop events, and to charge at those stops instead of dragging battery-tender dead weight for prairie range. European OHLI/BEMU programs show short station wire can be built and used for charge; U.S. dual-modes and multi-MWh battery-loco / hybrid pilots show hybrid traction is not science fiction (those pilots are **kin ESS evidence**, not pocket-vs-full savings proof — see working figures). Policy hooks such as California’s Carl Moyer conversion cost-share and federal CRISI grants are a possible funding path for hybrid rolling stock and short wire; they are not the mechanism. The missing U.S. product is an honest split: **wire the stops, diesel the cruise**, scored on fuel, schedule, and dollars per mile of pocket versus dollars per mile of full wire.

Make-or-break is whether stop-related energy and time on a real corridor are large enough, and pockets short enough, that the hybrid package beats both “wire nothing” and “wire everything.”

## 5. How you'd know

**Energy**

- Share of trip traction energy spent in the pocket speed band (brake-in + accelerate-out) versus cruise, on the pilot corridor
- Diesel gallons (or kWh + gallons) per train-mile with pockets versus diesel baseline on the same schedule
- Regen energy captured into pack or wire per stop

**Schedule**

- Time from brake application to handoff speed, and station-to-station running time, versus diesel baseline
- Whether pocket acceleration recovers dwell without lengthening the timetable

**Infrastructure**

- Route-miles of wire installed versus full-corridor alternative on the same stops
- Capital and maintenance cost per pocket-mile, inside published cost bands — do not invent a national $/mile savings %
- Substation / feeder peaks at simultaneous dwell charge (European OCI peaks are a caution, not a U.S. number)

**Vehicle**

- Pack state of charge entering and leaving each pocket
- Share of departures that complete acceleration under wire versus falling back to diesel mid-pocket
- Failures when the next pocket is dark or occupied

Units of wire installed are a weak number if they do not show fuel and time moving.

## 6. First test

One existing dense-stop corridor (commuter or intercity passenger preferred for shorter run-ups; a short premium-freight shuttle only if stop density is real). Wire **a handful of station pockets**, not the whole line. Run a hybrid or dual-mode consist that can take wire, store, and diesel-cruise. Log energy and time for **at least 90 days** against a diesel baseline on the same stops.

**Precursor, not the test:** paper pocket lengths from measured acceleration curves for the chosen consist; feeder and contact limits for dwell charge; pack size that covers one missed pocket without stranding the train.

**Scored in public:**

1. **Stop share.** Measured fraction of traction energy (and of schedule time) in brake-in / accelerate-out on that corridor. If stop-related energy is small, the thesis fails for that corridor even if the hardware works.
2. **Pocket length.** Installed wire per station stays inside the design envelope and far below full station-to-station electrification. If pockets grow to continuous wire, call it electrification and stop using this card’s name.
3. **Fuel and time.** Diesel-plus-electric trip fuel and station-to-station time beat diesel-only by enough to matter to the operator — threshold set before the pilot, not after.
4. **Charge honesty.** Pack SoC trend across a service day does not silently drain; dwell-plus-regen-plus-wired-accel keeps the next departure honest, or the consist falls back to diesel without stranding.
5. **Cost shape.** Pocket capital per route-mile served, compared on equal scope to a full-wire alternative for the same stops. Directional win is enough for a first test; do not invent a national payback.

If passenger pockets work and freight is still unproven, say that. Do not sell a Class I prairie product off a commuter pilot.

## 7. Open questions

- On which U.S. corridor is stop-related traction energy a large enough share to justify the first pockets?
- Pocket length versus handoff speed for a named passenger consist, and for a named freight consist?
- How much dwell charge is real at U.S. passenger dwells versus turnback / overnight sits?
- Pack size that covers one dark or missed pocket without becoming a full-corridor battery?
- **OCS gap / worst arriving SoC:** What pocket spacing and pack size cover the **lowest** charge state of trains arriving from connecting routes — not the average — so a junction pocket is honest for the worst feeder consist?
- Feeder peaks when several trains dwell-charge at once in one bubble?
- Clearance, bridge, and railroad-host rules for short catenary on lines that refuse full electrification?
- Who owns the pockets — passenger agency, host railroad, or a third-party wire company?
- Does Heavy FedEx-style premium freight actually stop often enough for this card, or only passenger?
- Do Carl Moyer / CRISI-style grants change the first-corridor TCO enough to fund pockets plus hybrid consists, or only rolling-stock retrofits?

## 8. Why it might not work

- **Stop energy is small** on the corridors with money — cruise and grade dominate; pockets buy little fuel or time.
- **Pockets grow** until they are continuous wire with a hybrid sticker.
- **Dwell is too short** and regen into a finite pack is not enough; the train leaves under wire with an empty pack and diesels the acceleration anyway.
- **Freight run-ups are too long**; multi-mile pockets per stop erase the savings versus selective district electrification.
- **Host railroads refuse** short catenary on shared track (clearance, liability, maintenance, pantograph strikes).
- **Dual hardware stays expensive**; railroads buy either diesel or full electric, not the hybrid middle.
- **Substation peaks** at busy stations make each pocket as hard as a conventional electrification node.
- **Battery degradation / cold weather / hotel loads** eat the pack budget between pockets (~30% Li-ion capacity loss at -20°C is a directional chemistry note, not a pocket design number).
- **Worst-case arriving SoC** forces pockets closer or packs larger than average-gap math suggests; homogeneity across connecting routes is missing.
- **The wrong first corridor** (sparse stops) fails publicly and poisons denser corridors that might have worked.
- **Politics demand full electrification** or nothing; a pocket pilot is framed as delay.
- **Kin pilot percentages get misread as pocket proof** — yard idle cuts, shunt hybrids, and FLXDrive fuel % are hybrid/ESS results, not evidence that station pockets beat full wire on Class I prairie.

What would make this wrong: measured stop-share too small, pockets as long as the gaps, packs empty at departure, or costs that match full wire for little schedule or fuel gain.

## 9. Stress-test

**“Most stop-related fuel and schedule cost.”** The Claim’s “most” is the disagreeable word. Piedmont hotspot data (about 20% of length, 40–50% of fuel/emissions) is directional for one passenger corridor and mixes acceleration with grade and speed. It is not a national proof that station acceleration alone is “most” of trip fuel. Keep “most” only as a hypothesis to measure in §6; if the pilot’s stop-band share is modest, rewrite the Claim downward or kill the corridor.

**“1–3 mile pockets.”** That band is a working envelope from acceleration-rate order-of-magnitude and European island lengths, not a surveyed U.S. design. Freight from a dead stop can need several miles. Publishing one length as settled would be invention.

**“Dwell charge makes the pack whole.”** Ordinary passenger dwells are often only minutes. European BEMU islands rely on turnbacks, terminals, and sized packs as much as on brief platform sits. This card’s honest primary jobs for the pocket are regen-in and wired accel-out; dwell top-off is bonus. Selling dwell-only recharge as the core would be wrong.

**“OHLI proves the thesis.”** OHLI/OCI proves short station wire and pantograph charge exist. Those programs are usually battery range-extenders without diesel cruise as the point. Kin hardware; different claim. Do not cite German island lengths as proof that U.S. diesel-hybrid pockets beat full wire.

**“Wire cost savings are automatic.”** Published $/mile bands are wide and scope-dependent. A pocket still needs poles, feeders, clearances, and maintenance discipline. Without an equal-scope bill of materials, “fraction of corridor cost” is a slogan. Score capital in the pilot; do not invent a savings percentage here.

**“Works for Class I freight.”** Long trains, low acceleration, sparse stops, and host-railroad rules are a different problem from dense-stop passenger. A passenger pocket win does not license a prairie freight claim. Yard idle (~80% diesel cut), shunt hybrids, and FLXDrive corridor fuel % are **kin hybrid/ESS evidence** — useful that packs and hybrid traction exist — not proof of station-pocket economics versus full wire.

**“AAR $1T / decades of profits.”** The ~$1T full-network figure is a study estimate that usefully names the capital wall. “Years of profits” framing in secondary synthesis is consultant-rounded rhetoric; keep the dollar barrier, do not treat the profit-years conversion as a measured payback clock for pockets.

**“OCS gaps from average SoC.”** Gap length must be designed for the **worst arriving charge state** from connecting routes. Average-SoC spacing understates the pack or the wire needed at junctions.

Wrong in one line: the first corridor shows stop-band energy is minor, the wire stretches station-to-station, and the hybrid still diesels the departure — or the card treats a single-corridor hotspot study, European BEMU islands, and yard/shunt hybrid % savings as proof of U.S. freight station-pocket economics.
